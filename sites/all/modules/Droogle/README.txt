README.txt
------------
The Droogle Module integrates Google Docs with Drupal. It provides a list of a 
configured google user's documents and allows uploading docs to that account. 
It also exposes much of the google docs api to Drupal users -- you can create 
collections, move documents into collections, etc. Droogle also works with 
Organic Groups and each Organic Group can hook up to a unique user account 
to manage it's group documents. 

The module's creation is sponsored by Babson College and is to be used to
better manage documents for groups, classes, etc. Integrating documents
with google means better access to documents on ipads, iphones, etc, since
there are many apps for these devices to sync your google docs account(s). 

Droogle is not to be confused with BBoogle, which is Blackboards
integration with Google Docs -- but Droogle works much the same way
and serves the same purpose. 

We are looking for ideas on how to improve the module to make it as
useful as possible in eduction and to the general community. We are
open to having co-maintainers, preferably with another college or university. 

INSTALL 
------------ 
You'll need to get Zend Gdata library downloaded
(http://framework.zend.com/download/gdata), 
just make sure the base directory with the Zend api is called "Zend"
and put that directory in the base of the Droogle module directory.
Here it is in github so you know exactly what it should look like: 

https://github.com/barnettech/Droogle. Also if you have any trouble getting 
Droogle to work with newer versions of the Google Gdata api you can download 
the Zend directory from github here to make sure you are using the same version 
of Gdata that I've tested Droogle with. 

I cannot put the Zend code on drupal.org although Zend provides
their code opensource, I couldn't get Droogle approved on Drupal.org
wihtout doing this -- I am trying to make this install as painless
as possible for you in any case. 

After the Zend directory is in place Droogle installs like all
Drupal Modules, just put it in the modules directory and enable
the module 

DROOGLE CONFIG AND SETUP 
------------------------ 
Go to admin/settings/droogle and put in usernames and password
for the google accounts you would like to use. You can optionally
setup Organic Groups to look for a group cck field to read the google
username and password from for each group. 
 
You can also make it so group owners who can edit their own group
can manually enter a google username and password to use. You will
have to know how to setup cck fields for the group content type to get
this organic group integration feature working. 

The module is presented as is under the opensource license that
is within the module for you to read, we make no guarantees. That
being said we're looking to make this module great and feel free
to submit issues and suggestions to our issue que. 

GOOGLE API Exposed for Drupal Developers 
----------------------------------------- 
Check out the google_tests.php file to check out how to call
the api using the command line to create users, delete users,
create folders (collections) and lots more. 
The Droogle module makes uses the Zend library and it's all bundled
up for you to easily use and extend.
